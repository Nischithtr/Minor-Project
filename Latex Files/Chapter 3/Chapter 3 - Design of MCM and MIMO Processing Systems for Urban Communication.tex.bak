\chapter{Chapter 3 - Design of MCM and MIMO Processing Systems for Urban Communication}

Every chapter should start with an introduction paragraph. This paragraph should brief about the flow of the chapter. This introduction can be limited within 4 to 5 sentences. The chapter heading should be appropriately modified (a sample heading is shown for this chapter).
 
\section{Basic Overview of our system}
This section contains the following. It has a basic block diagram view of our system. Like precoder, modulator, transmitter, channel, receiver, demodulator and estimator. We explain each section in detail in the following sections.


\section{Transmitter}

\subsection{QAM Modulator}
Here we explain the construction of the QAM modulator in detail and explain the recursive algorithm which we have used for the same.

\subsection{Alamouti Coder}
Here we explain the code relating to the Alamouti coder. We have already discussed the theory behind Alamouti codes, here we just explain our code which implements it.

\subsection{Tone Loading Algorithm for the tr

\section{Channel Estimation}
\subsection{PRBS Generator}
Here we explain the PRBS generator and the logic of our PRBS Code.

\subsection{AWGN Noise}
A small section explaining the AWGN noise that we are adding to our transmitted bit stream.

\subsection{Rayleigh Fading}
A small section discussing the implementation of Rayleigh Fading in our channel.

\subsection{Path Loss Function}
A section describing the path loss function we are using and the various components of the formula.

After elaborating the various sections of the chapter, a summary paragraph should be written discussing the highlights of that particular chapter. This summary paragraph should not be numbered separately.
