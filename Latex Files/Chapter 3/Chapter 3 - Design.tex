\chapter{Chapter 3 - Design of MCM and MIMO Processing Systems for Urban Communication}

This chapter focuses on the algorithms implemented as part of the \acrshort{mcm} \acrshort{mimo} system. We look into the different aspects of transmitter block, channel parameters and receiver block. We look into the simulation of \acrshort{siso}, \acrshort{simo} ( transmit \gls{spatial diversity}), \acrshort{miso} (\acrshort{ostbc}) and \acrshort{mimo} ( both \gls{spatial diversity} and multiplexing(inverse channel decoding and \acrshort{svd})). 
 
\section{Basic Overview of our system}

The below figure shows the general block diagram of a communication system. We discuss all the blocks in great detain in this session.

\section{Transmitter}

\subsection{PRBS Generator}
Here we explain the PRBS generator and the logic of our PRBS Code.

\subsection{Tone Loading Algorithm for the transmitter}
Here we explain in detail the tone loading algorithm (fine gains algorithm) which we have implemented in our code.

\subsection{QAM Modulator}
Here we explain the construction of the QAM modulator in detail and explain the recursive algorithm which we have used for the same.
