Modern day mobile communication systems rely heavily on \acrlong{mcm} (\acrshort{mcm}) and \acrlong{mimo}(\acrshort{mimo}) technologies the challenges predominantly faced are of maximizing data rates and capacity. In this report, a methodology is developed to use current \acrshort{4g} and future \acrshort{5g} systems in both diversity and multiplexing modes to improve on both data rates and capacities.  Theoretically, it is possible to use \acrlong{siso}(\acrshort{siso}) systems to achieve the same capacities and data rates. However, the complexities involved in designing \gls{modems} that are capable of achieving these rates are too cost prohibitive and thus it becomes necessary  to address this problem through \acrshort{mcm} and \acrshort{mimo}.\\

\acrshort{mimo} however is too broad a term as it consists of various configurations and setups. A system which can be operated in two modes is designed, namely diversity and multiplexing. Diversity is suitable for low \acrshort{snr} regimes where, multiple copies of the same data needs to be sent to maintain a feasible \acrlong{qos}(\acrshort{qos}). Multiplexing is the scheme of choice in high \acrshort{snr} regimes where the option exists to maximize data rates and capacity by transmitting differing data over good channels. that are already providing good \acrshort{ber}.\\


This report shows the simulations of the work with the help of \gls{matlab}. The ultimate goal of this report is to design a $2 \times 2$ \acrshort{mimo} system and in this regard, at first a \acrshort{siso} system is designed to lay the foundation for multi carrier communication systems. Further, a $1 \times 2$ \acrshort{simo} and $2 \times 1$ \acrshort{miso} system is also designed to operate in diversity mode. Finally, a $2 \times 2$ \acrshort{mimo} system is designed to work in both diversity and multiplexing modes to improve the data rates and capacities. The design of this system employs unique precoding schemes like Alamouti coding, Inverse Channel Estimation precoding and \acrshort{svd} precoding. This report also demonstrates the use of \gls{rayleigh fading} and Friis' path loss formula for real world simulation purposes.
