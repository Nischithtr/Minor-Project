\chapter{Conclusion and Future Scope}
We end this report by stating that we have definitively shown in this report through our simulations, that \acrshort{mcm} and \acrshort{mimo} can be effectively used to improve user capacity and data rates. We have shown how switching to diversity in low \acrshort{snr} regimes and multiplexing in high \acrshort{snr} regimes can maintain good \acrlong{qos} for users. Thus, we can build upon existing \acrshort{4g} and \acrshort{5g} systems and expand them to be used in multiplexing scheme along with diversity.

\section{Future Scope}
For readers, we suggest further improvements can be done by improving upon the channel modeling by introducing more real world phenomenon like shadowing and use more complex path loss functions like Ricean distribution.\\
Another scope for improvisation is in the scope of the system. Here, we have limited ourselves to $2 \times 2$ \acrshort{mimo} systems. We encourage the reader to implement large systems leading to massive \acrshort{mimo} systems.\\
