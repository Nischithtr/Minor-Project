\chapter{Conclusion and Future Scope}
We end this report by stating that we have definitively shown in this report through our simulations, that \acrshort{mcm} and \acrshort{mimo} can be effectively used to improve user capacity and data rates. We have shown how switching to diversity in low \acrshort{snr} regimes and multiplexing in high \acrshort{snr} regimes can maintain good \acrlong{qos} for users. Thus, we can build upon existing \acrshort{4g} and \acrshort{5g} systems and expand them to be used in multiplexing scheme along with diversity.

\section{Future Scope}
For readers, we suggest further improvements can be done by improving upon the channel modeling by introducing more real world phenomenon like sh
